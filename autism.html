	<strong> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) </strong> is a broad term used 
	to describe a group  of neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are 
	characterized by problems with communication  and social interaction. 
	People with ASD often demonstrate restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped interests 
	or patterns of behavior.ASD is found in individuals around the world, 
	regardless of race, culture, or economic background.
	
	The CDC estimated in 2014 that nearly 1 in 59 children have been identified with ASD.
	There are indications that instances of ASD are on the rise. Some attribute this increase to
	environmental factors. 	However, experts debate whether thereâ€™s an actual increase in cases 
	or just more frequent diagnoses.
