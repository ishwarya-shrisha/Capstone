<strong> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) </strong> is a broad term used 
to describe a group  of neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are 
characterized by problems with  communication  and social interaction. 
People with ASD often demonstrate restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped interests 
or patterns of behavior.ASD is found in individuals around the world, 
regardless of race, culture, or economic background.

The CDC estimated in 2014 that nearly 1 in 59 children have been identified with ASD.
There are indications that instances of ASD are on the rise. Some attribute this increase to
environmental factors. 	However, experts debate whether there’s an actual increase in cases 
or just more frequent diagnoses.
