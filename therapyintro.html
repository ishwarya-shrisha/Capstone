    <h2> Applied Behavior Analysis(ABA) Therapy </h2>

        <strong> ABA is short for Applied Behavioral Analysis, and it is often described as the "gold standard" for autism treatment. Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)is a system of autism treatment based on behaviorist theories which, simply put, state that desired behaviors can be taught through a system of rewards and consequences. ABA can be thought of as applying behavioral principles to behavioral goals and carefully measuring the results.
While the idea of using rewards and consequences to teach behavior is probably as old as human civilization, the idea of carefully applying rewards and consequences to achieve specific, measurable goals is relatively new. While many people are strong advocates of ABA because of it's demonstrable success in achieving specific outcomes, others believe it is at best disrespectful and, at worst, actually damaging to the individual.

    <h2> Occupational Therapy </h2>

        <strong> Occupational therapy (OT) helps people work on cognitive, physical, social, and motor skills. The goal is to improve everyday skills which allow people to become more independent and participate in a wide range of activities. 

                For people with autism, OT programs often focus on play skills, learning strategies, and self-care. OT strategies can also help to manage sensory issues.
                
                The occupational therapist will begin by evaluating the person's current level of ability. The evaluation looks at several areas, including how the person:
                
                Learns
                Plays
                Cares for themselves
                Interacts with their environment

        <strong> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) </strong> is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are characterized by problems with communication and social interaction. People with ASD often
        demonstrate restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped interests or patterns of behavior.ASD is found in individuals around the world, regardless of race, culture, or economic background. The CDC estimated in 2014 that nearly 1 in 59 children have
        been identified with ASD. There are indications that instances of ASD are on the rise. Some attribute this increase to environmental factors. However, experts debate whether there’s an actual increase in cases or just more frequent diagnoses.
